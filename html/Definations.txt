1.What is Testing?
  
->Testing deals with finding the defects by conducting failure on the application or product.
->This activity is performed by Testers.

2. What is Software Testing?
  
->It is  a process of validating an applicatin against the client requirents for postive and negative test conditions.
->S/w Testing is a process of identifing  the correctness of s/w by considering it's all attributes(reliablity,scalability,usability...etc) 
   and evoluating the execution of s/w components to find the s/w bugs (or) errors (or) defects.

3.What is Static Testing?

->It is a verification process and testing is done on the deliverable without executing the build is called static testing.
->Static Testing is done through inspection ,walk through & reviews.

4.What is Dynamic Testing?

->It is a validation process where the functional and non-functional testing are performed.
->The Build is exercised in the  run time environment to check it's feature /functionalities,it is called Dynamic Testing.
 
4(1)Verification
 
->It is proces of checking documents,design,code inorder to check if the application meets the user requirements (or) not.

4(2)Validating

->It is process of validating the deliverables against the client requirement.

5.Testing Levels:
         
              There are four levels of testing,we have
                              
                                 1.Unit Testing.

                                 2.Integration Testing.
                                 
                                 3.System Testing.
                                    
                                 4.UAT Testing.
5(A)White Box Testing:

             The internal structure and code of an application .It is done by the developer.
                                 
                                 1.Unit Testing.
                                 
                                 2.Integration Testing.
